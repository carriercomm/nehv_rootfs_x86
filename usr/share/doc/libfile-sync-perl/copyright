This is Debian GNU/Linux's prepackaged version of File::Sync.  This is a set
of perl modules which provide access to the POSIX fsync and sync calls.

This package was put originally  together by Michael Alan Dorman.
The original sources should always be available from the Comprehensive Perl
Archive Network (CPAN). Visit <URL:http://www.perl.com/CPAN/> to find a CPAN
site near you.

The only change for the Debian package was the addition of the debian/
files.

The File::Sync copright is as follows:
